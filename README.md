## About this repository
This is a submission for a coursera project as described <a href="https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/README.md">here</a>.

Each of the plots created only depict data  from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02.

The description of each of the files follow:
* <b>plot1.R</b>: Code to generate a histogram for global active power data.
* <b>plot2.R</b>: Code to generate a line plot for global active power data.
* <b>plot3.R</b>: Code to generate 3 line plots on one graph, one corresponding to each of the three sub-meterings.
* <b>plot4.R</b>: Code to generate 4 plots. Firstly, on the top left, a line plot for global active power data. Secondly, on the bottom left, a graph with 3 line plots, one corresponding to each of the three sub-meterings. Thirdly, to the top right, a line plot for Voltage. And lastly, at the bottom right, a line plot for global reactive power.
